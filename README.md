# persistent_rope

[![build status](https://gitlab.com/sphinx-text/persistent_rope/badges/master/build.svg)](https://gitlab.com/sphinx-text/persistent_rope/commits/master)

A rope data structure with persistence in Rust. I'm writing this mostly as
practice (though I do intend to use it for another hobby project) and make
no claims about performance, correctness, or code quality. Yet.
